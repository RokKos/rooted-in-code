The film takes place in the year 2057. In a polluted city, a permaculture garden flourishes on the roof of a skyscraper, tended by a robot gardener and an elderly botanist. Appealing to all ages, the film speculates on the degraded state of the environment, nature and the ecosystem in the future, but at the same time presents a utopian vision and solutions to the environmental crisis. It also brings into the equation a question of the impact artificial intelligence will have on our society, our daily lives and our environment.

When animating, the filmmaker Nejc Trampuž explored the capabilities of the rapidly evolving tools of generative artificial intelligence. Those are shaking up the social and artistic realms and entering the field of film production and gaming. The tools were used to generate elements of animation and sound, as well as to write the story, script and visual design of characters and scenes. He worked with the artist and sound designer Tim Kropivšek to create the audio, and the voice was performed by the actor and interpreter Blaž Šef.
